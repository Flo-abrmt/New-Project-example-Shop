# New-Project-example-Shop

This is my first try building a shopping site.

This will have no eyecandy and stuff like that Im just trying to make it all work and looks can be changed afterwards.

This is also my first time using a database and working with one. I'll use mongo atlas for this in combination with the lib mongoose and the framework node.js.  

For the Frontend HTML, CSS and Javascript.
For Backend Javascript again.

May I switch some things up but in the end a user should be able to make and account, login, add products to the site, select products to buy "but obviously for no money" and get an confirmation e-mail for the purchase.
